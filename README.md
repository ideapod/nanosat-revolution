# Nanosat Revolution 

## Introduction
Nanosat revolution is a project to put a telescope into a cubesat and capture the resulting images to be published on itelescope.com. The project is based in melbourne. The project has a [main site](http://nanosatrevolution.com). we are also using [slack] (nanosatrevolution.slack.com) for discussing and keeping ourselves up to date.

## The codebase
This repository contains the code for an arduino based prototype. The prototype will bring together a camera, comms modules operating at amateur frequencies, an Inertial measurement unit (IMU), solar power, and an attitude determination and control system to demostrate the base functionality of the satellite. We will also build ground station software that will receive the data and publish to a website. 

## how you can help
Please register on [nanosat revolution](http://nanosatrevolution.com). I will add you to the slack channels and you can follow along. We need people that understand:
- arduino
- *Nix based embedded software development (think ARM based systems like beaglebone, edison, raspberry PI)
- Software Defined Radio (SDR) to manage comms b
- optical instrument design and image processing ( to build the telescope payload).
- aerospace concepts - orbits, attitude control, the space environment, etc.

Finally, we have a [monthly meetup](http://meetu.ps/c/2xfcY/1jjZ5/a). we'd love to have you along.
